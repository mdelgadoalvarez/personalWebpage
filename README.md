# personalWebpage

Description: I created my personal website when I was a student for the Allen School Scholars program. But then I edited it for current students in the Allen School Scholars Program when I became a student lead. I designed it for students to learn more about me through general information and personal photos. This was a project where I was able to learn new technical languages, like HTML and CSS, as well as be able to use my creativity in order to design my webpage. I was then able to upload my personal webpage to the University of Washington student server in order to make it public. In the future, I hope to be able to make changes and incorporate JavaScript in order to make it more interactive.
